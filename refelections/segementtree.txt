LOOK UP Table:

The lookup table is used to answer the range queries.
Lookup table requires O(n**2) time and O(n**2) space to construct it.
It only takes O(1) time to get query result.
It takes O(n**2) time for updation of array.
It is preferred when the array size is small or where there is no restriction on memory
It is preferred when there are more range queries and there are no updates to array.


SQUARE ROOT DECOMPOSITION:

It takes O(n) time and O(n) memory to construct it.
It takes O(sqrt(n)) time to answer the query.

SEGMENT TREE:

It takes O(Log(n)) time and O(2*Log(n)-1) space to construct it.
It takes O(Log(n)) time to answer the query.
It takes O(Log(n)) time to update the array.
It is preferred when the size of the array is large, when the array have more number updation to the array.
